# Food-Waste-Management-Application
I made a really cool app using Python. It does a bunch of useful things like checking if users are who they say they are, letting them add, edit, and delete products, making sure the info they give is correct, and remembering who's logged in.

I used Android Studio to make it work nicely on Android phones and Python to handle all the tricky stuff. Plus, the app is eco-friendly because it includes a whole recycling process. So not only is it helpful, but it's also good for the environment.This app isn't just about managing stuff, though. It's also got a complete recycling process built in, making it super eco-friendly and useful for anyone who wants to go green.
